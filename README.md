# Traffic-Light-Simulation
This Logisim project emulates a basic traffic light and pedestrian signal system. Leveraging two clocks, ROMs, a reset button, splitters, and LEDs, it replicates the behavior of real-world traffic lights and pedestrian signals. Explore the intricacies of digital circuit design in a simulated environment.
